Playing with basic 3D in canvas

Step 1 : Let's start with 2D as my school lessons in trigonometry are long forgotten

Let's draw squares at diverse distances from the origin point (0,0)  
Add circles to show that represent their future rotation along the camera origin
let's rotate the camera angle around the origin and draw an arrow to indicate direction
the head of the arrow uses arctant2() to calculate its angle (good pratice)

ToDO : 
allow the camera to move from the origin point with an arrow that is not buggy !
calculate the angle of the squares compared to the angle the camera
be able to do the same where ever the camera is
stop moving or rotation de camera arrow but move and rotate the word around
go 3D with wireframe cubes
