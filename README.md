# 2DSansBox
Playing with basic 2D in canvas

Step 1 : Let's start with 2D as my school lessons in trigonometry are long forgotten

Let's draw squares at diverse distances from the origin point (0,0)  
Add circles to show that represent their future rotation along the camera origin
let's rotate the camera angle around the origin and draw an arrow to indicate direction
the head of the arrow uses arctant2() to calculate its angle (good pratice)
The camera is also able to move back and forth.

ToDO : 
Move the background and not the player who will stay un the center
make an infinite (or wide) area, with random items (rocks, flowers, ponds, flowers, bushes)
store the coordinates of the game in local storage or in a database (maybe firebase)
add creatures and narration
add variations with time (mobs, vegetation)
add capacity to hold some items and put then in different locations
add multiplayer capicity
